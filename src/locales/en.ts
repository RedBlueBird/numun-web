    paragraph2: 'The purpose of NUMUN is to provide a platform for youth to engage with contemporary affairs. By stepping into the role of a UN delegate, students represent their respective nations, research global issues and articulate their positions in committees. In the process, they hone their critical thinking, communication and negotiation skills, build international networks and develop as future leaders prepared to engage with the world\'s most pressing challenges.',
