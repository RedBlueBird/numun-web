    greeting: `Greetings to our delegates, supervisors, and guests!

My name is Edeline, a fourth-year Agricultural Sciences student. This year, I have the honor of serving as NUMUN's Secretary General. Though I have only been part of the team for two years, I plan to do my best with all the organizing team members to make NUMUN another success. It is always inspiring to see all the planning and hard work come together into a meaningful and impactful event.

I believe that NUMUN is a unique space where individuals passionate about their own interests can gather and inspire one another—watching the dedication of delegates, chairs, and staff members motivates me to work even harder. I look forward to seeing the conferences unfold in their own special ways and to connecting with everyone involved.

See you next year in NUMUN 2025!

Best,
Edeline`,

    greeting: `Dear esteemed delegates, chairs, and supervisors!

Nice to meet you all! My name is Kayla Haruni, most people call me Haru! I am currently a 4th year Biological Science student. Although I still have much to learn, I am very honored to be trusted as one of the Deputy Secretary General for NUMUN 2025.

With so many things happening in our world, it is important to cultivate awareness, open-mindedness, and empathy. Through MUN, delegates can exercise their problem-solving skills whilst being exposed to a spectrum of perspectives. For next year we hope to make NUMUN a meaningful and positive experience to those involved!

I would also like to thank everyone— the participants, supervisors, sponsors, and most of all our dedicated and hardworking organizing team members as they are essential to making our event a success.

Please look forward to NUMUN 2025!!

Sincerely,
Haru`,
